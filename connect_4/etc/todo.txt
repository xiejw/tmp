Few things as next steps

- Reresolve all the warnings in the code. The even kernel is odd. We likely need
  a weight rewrite to make that happen.

- Benchmark on CPU vs MPS. Benchmark on different batch sizes. to see the
  differences.

- Export the model from Python to C++. Might need to figure how to do python
  side CFLAGS and LDFLAGS.

- Use Rust to write more efficient code.

- Use Rust to implement parallel algorithrm
