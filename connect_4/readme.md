Connect Four
============

According to Wikipedia:

> Connect Four is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose
a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a
seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down,
occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the
game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four
of one's own discs.
